        <tr>
    It is way more important to look for what you do not know, rather than searching for what you already know. In order to do that, some undefined space at the starting point is necessary. I noticed that whenever I stop looking specifically for the answer to the question that I asked myself, I discover things that I would have never found otherwise. This random encounters with ideas and new discoveries, were in fact caused by not doing what was intended. 
    I had this question on my mind: how can we creatively profit from doing nothing? Is it possible to gain something from plain time-wasting? How is it possible that we find more when we do not look for it? Does it happen because when we do ‘nothing’ we are also less serious, because there is nothing to be concerned about? This problem is my research subject.

    I was concerned if there would be enough time to look for the answers. However, there was even more time required for determining what should be the question (and only after finding the answer I also did find the question). At some point of my research in the subject of play this question became the question that could be used for defining the starting point for my thesis. Can we profit from doing nothing as designers?

    I analyse in what ways does playfulness (as a possible contrary of seriousness) broaden the possibilities of creativity. How does the economy of time in the society that we live in, influences us? Is everything transformed into waiting? On the given examples I am showing how important is taking the time to ‘stop doing’.
    Eventually when faced with boredom we seek out for a solution to stop that feeling immediately. Boredom is unwelcome. However, it turns out that boredom has a value on its own, that we might find more fruitful than expected. 

    For the most part, I could not make my thesis if I was not playing. Through play I was able to construct a certain way of relating to information.

    In my thesis, the reader can make himself familiar with the instructions on how to proceed with the manner of reading. Replacing introduction with instructions may offer possibility for more engaging reading experience, because the reader is not preconditioned about what he is going to experience, but instead he can explore the content according to his own rules. Through these means I am exploring the notion of playfulness in creating one’s own rules. In the end a platform for reading is like a platform for thought, and reading is fast guessing.1 Therefore reading can be interpreted as a game to perform with oneself. 
    Depending on the track you followed the result is different.
