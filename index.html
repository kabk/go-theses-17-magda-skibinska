BOREDOM IN ACTION
There exists a saying that intelligent people do not get bored. I would hear that sentence a lot when I was a child. Sometimes however, hearing that, made me feel like I should not allow myself to feel bored in the first place. Not doing anything and the resulting  , however, can be defined otherwise than just boredom. This is especially told to children by their parents, most likely when they do not have time to amuse their child. The general tendency is, that when we start getting bored we feel the urge to get creative in order to escape that feeling. The ability to create an engaging task (or game) for oneself in this example, can serve as a proof of someone’s intelligence. But, contrarily one might also say that high intelligence requires constant supply of stimuli. The synonyms of intelligence are amongst others: inventiveness, resourcefulness, creativity, which means that intelligence its not only about the possession of the knowledge but also about the practical aspect of being skilled in profiting inventively from it. Because an active mind needs the continual change in order to be satisfied, with only one task to do, it is most likely to get bored relatively fast. The possible solution to this problem, was subject of Søren Kierkegaard ‘rotation method’. He elaborated on this problem in the 1843 work Either/Or: A Fragment of Life. Following the line of argumentation of this Danish philosopher, in order to avoid boredom, constant shifting between performed tasks is necessary. The result would theoretically be, the certainty that everyone can be provided with more-less constant satisfaction. Without a doubt, the level of proficiency in creativity necessary for such inventiveness needs to be high. The individual seeking for such satisfactory life is referred to as an aesthete (a person that values beauty in life, from Greek aisthētḗs – one who perceives)

As the land should be left fallow for certain amount of time in order to remain fertile, likewise the aesthetes should be constantly switching from one task to another and changing himself constantly. This anti-boredom (or possibly anti-burn out) method can be applied as a hedonistic tool in gaining satisfaction from the ‘aesthetic’ way of life. However, agreeing with the philosopher, this repetitive search for novel, ultimately leads to a state of despair. The resulting impossibility of commitment to one thing, as commitment requires repetition of one activity. This ultimately superficial in its core approach, as there is no happiness on a path leading from one extreme to another.

Kierkegaard elaborates further, on boredom as emptiness. Concluding that boredom is not the absence of stimulation, but the absence of meaning. Nowadays, this problem of overstimulation and simultaneous existential boredom can be valid more than ever. All activities no matter how often juggled between one another, will cease being interesting at some point. And eventually one might say: “I don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel like riding – the motion is too powerful; I don’t feel like walking – it is too tiring; I don’t feel like lying down, for either I have to stay down, and I don’t feel like doing that or I would have to get up again, and I don’t feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don’t feel like doing anything.” (Either/Or, p. 4)
Although threatened by the imminent possibility of ending, this approach can be an attempt of experiencing a more meaningful life.
