The platform can begin with instructions or a disclaimer that there is no instructions.<br>

Replacing introduction with instructions may offer possibility for more engaging reading experience, because the reader is not preconditioned about what he is going to experience but instead he/she can explore the content according to his own rules. <br>

Platform for reading is like a platform for thought, a book can be seen as a different platform for reading than a website, so are they also platforms of different thoughts? Because reading is fast guessing, reading can be interpreted as a game to perform with oneself.(<span class="ref">after Marshall McLuhan  <span class="bibliography">ABC Radio National Network. (1979, June 27). The Medium Is The Message [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.sam-network.org/

The system serves a purpose of improvising a reading method where decisions have to be made fast in order to gather information. Like a system of alternative versions. <br>

On what parameters could the order of text change?<br>

Should the new things be on top? Shorter paragraphs placed in groups can allow for more improvised way of reading.<br>
        
All the text can be on top of each other. The viewer will be able to redistribute the content in order to make the reading rules according to his/her own choosing.<br>

<div class="paragraph-small"><p>
On a map/multi-centered text layout things are updated locally while the other areas can be left unchanged for long time, the content does not only have contextual location within the clouds of different paragraphs but also a physical location in space that I remember and use it to locate it. So the text is placed according to its relation to other texts and sometimes its continued (for example) only in the top left direction. I also have a tendency to focus more on the top parts than the bottom parts, and the ‘lower placed’ content is more abstract or ‘not yet explained.’

The content evolves not only from top to the bottom like in a traditional understanding of text layout but also, or even more, grows on sides. The intention is that there is no spatial hierarchy and that the order of reading is free. Thus, the groups of paragraphs does not necessarily indicate the next group of paragraphs. 

As a result, such platform of reading is a platform of thought in such sense that it does not force the thinking into an different form of transcription. But rather remains a visualisation of the mind.

Creating within a system of constrictions is always a necessity at some point of design.
